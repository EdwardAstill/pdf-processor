# pdfp Architecture

## pdfp's competitive moat

pdfp holds a unique position among PDF tools. These are the things that make it different — and that must be protected in every change:

1. **Single binary, zero Python** — No Python runtime, no GPU required, no venv. One ~20MB compiled binary does everything. This is the strongest differentiator against Docling (60k★), MinerU (64k★), and every other PDF→Markdown tool.

2. **Offline-first, privacy-respecting** — All processing happens locally. No cloud API calls unless explicitly opted into (`--hybrid docling`). Works in air-gapped environments, compliance-sensitive workflows, and CI pipelines.

3. **Full extraction→layout→classify→render pipeline** — Not just text dumping. pdfp reconstructs reading order (XY-Cut++), classifies blocks (headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, captions, code, formulas), detects tables and formulas, and renders structured Markdown. Most Rust PDF tools stop at text extraction.

4. **Custom eval framework** — No other Rust PDF tool has precision/recall metrics for formula detection, heading accuracy, table recall, figure retention, and decorative image suppression. This is essential for measuring quality over time.

5. **Multi-format output** — Raw Markdown, chunked RAG output, Karpathy-style wiki folders, knowledge graph JSON, and Typst conversion. Purpose-built for AI/LLM consumption pipelines.

6. **Markdown→Typst bridge** — Unique path from Markdown to the modern Typst typesetting ecosystem. Enables high-quality PDF generation from extracted Markdown.

7. **Conservative/review-safe mode** — `--conservative` disables speculative reconstruction (tables as Markdown tables, formulas as LaTeX) and emits only layout-preserving output. Critical for engineering/legal/standards documents where accuracy > prettiness.

8. **Page operations in the same binary** — Extract, delete, split, reorder, merge, resize, impose (2-up, booklet). No need for separate tools like qpdf or pdftk.

## Key design decisions

### MuPDF as the rendering engine

pdfp uses MuPDF (AGPL) via the `mupdf` 0.6 crate. MuPDF was chosen because:
- It's the fastest PDF renderer
- It bundles as C source, compiled via `cc` — no system library dependency
- It handles text extraction, image extraction, and page rendering
- The AGPL is compatible with pdfp's MIT license as long as pdfp remains open-source

Tradeoff: MuPDF is not thread-safe. Outer loops are sequential `.iter().map()`. Do not use `rayon`/`par_iter` for PDF processing.

MuPDF 0.6 does not expose font family names through its Rust wrapper. The `pdfium-metadata` optional feature adds a second-opinion reader for font names and struct-tree access.

### XY-Cut++ layout analysis

The reading order algorithm is a Rust port of OpenDataLoader's `XYCutPlusPlusSorter.java` (Apache-2.0), based on arXiv:2504.10258. It uses recursive gap-based segmentation with narrow-outlier retry on the X axis. The coordinate system is top-left origin (Y grows downward), which is the opposite of PDF's Y-up — every Y comparison in the algorithm is flipped relative to the Java reference.

### lopdf for low-level PDF manipulation

`lopdf` 0.40 is used for metadata read/write and PDF object manipulation. It operates at the raw PDF object level (dictionaries, arrays, streams, references). pdfp uses it for document information dictionary fields (title, author, subject, keywords, creator, producer, dates). The same approach works for reading annotation dictionaries and form field values.

### mupdf's pdf module (currently unused)

mupdf 0.6 exposes a rich `pdf` sub-module (`PdfDocument`, `PdfPage`, `PdfAnnotation`, `PdfWriteOptions`) that pdfp does not currently use. This module provides:
- Outline/bookmark extraction
- Annotation enumeration and creation
- Page rotation, crop box, media box
- PDF save with compression, linearization, encryption, garbage collection

These are documented in `plans/stages/plan.md` Stage 2 and represent ~470 lines of integration code to unlock 11 new features.

### Coordinate system

MuPDF uses `Rect { x0, y0, x1, y1 }` — corner coordinates, not `(x, y, w, h)`. `Bbox` mirrors this. Origin is top-left, Y increases downward. This is consistent through the entire pipeline.

### Error types

`PdfpError` (formerly `VtvError`) is the library error type using `thiserror`. `PdfpResult<T>` is the convenience alias. CLI commands use `anyhow::Result` at the outermost level and convert from `PdfpError` where needed.

### `<!-- page:N -->` markers

The `MarkdownRenderer` emits page markers (1-indexed) consumed by `split_into_sections()` for page tracking. These are stripped from section content in the final output.

### Heading level derivation

Heading levels are derived from font size ratio against the body text mode:
- >=2.0× body → H1
- >=1.6× body → H2
- >=1.35× body → H3
- >=1.15× body → H4
- else → H5

With the `pdfium-metadata` feature, struct-tree roles (`H1`..`H6`, `Title`) override this, and bold-at-body-size gets promoted to H4.

## Test structure

```
tests/
├── eval_fixtures/      # JSON fixture files for quality evaluation
├── table_detection.rs  # Integration tests for table detection
└── ...                 # Other integration tests
```

- `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` — must be clean before committing
- `cargo test` — runs unit tests + integration tests
- `pdfp eval tests/eval_fixtures/` — quality evaluation against fixtures

## Future directions

See `plans/stages/plan.md` for the staged improvement plan:
- Stage 1: Consolidation & refactoring (current)
- Stage 2: Quick wins using existing mupdf APIs
- Stage 3: Medium features (forms, PDF/A, CJK)
- Stage 4: Advanced (Markdown→PDF, signatures, OmniDocBench)
