# PDF internals — the parts that matter to `cnv`

This is a primer on how PDF files are actually structured, aimed at contributors who need to understand why `cnv`'s PDF-to-markdown pipeline behaves the way it does — why some things come through cleanly, why others are silently lost, and where the interesting hooks are for future improvements.

It is opinionated: it only covers the PDF features that `cnv` touches, avoids, or is blocked by. It is not a replacement for the 1,000-page ISO 32000-2 specification. For the full formal definition, read that. For the working mental model, read this.

## The 30-second mental model

A PDF file is a tree of versioned, reference-counted **objects**. At the root is a `Catalog`. The catalog points to a `Pages` node, which points to an ordered list of `Page` objects. Each `Page` has a **content stream** — a program in a small stack-based graphics language — that, when interpreted, paints the page. Text is drawn by calling `Tj` / `TJ` operators that place glyphs from a specified font at specified positions. Everything else — fonts, images, forms, overlays — is a dictionary hanging off a page or the catalog.

That is the entire architecture. Fifteen words: *tree of objects, each page is a program, text is drawn as glyphs*. Everything the `cnv` codebase worries about flows from that shape.

## The object tree

Concretely, a PDF is a sequence of versioned objects:

```
1 0 obj
<< /Type /Catalog /Pages 2 0 R >>
endobj

2 0 obj
<< /Type /Pages /Kids [3 0 R 4 0 R] /Count 2 >>
endobj

3 0 obj
<< /Type /Page
   /Parent 2 0 R
   /Contents 5 0 R
   /Resources << /Font << /F1 7 0 R >> >>
   /MediaBox [0 0 612 792]
>>
endobj
```

`1 0 R` is a reference to object 1, generation 0. The catalog, pages node, and page objects form a tree. `/Contents` on a page points to the content-stream object. `/Resources` names the fonts and images the content stream will reference by short alias (`F1`, `Im1`, …).

`cnv` never walks this tree directly. mupdf does it all for us. What matters is that the model has named resources per page — so when mupdf tells us "this glyph was drawn in font F1", we know F1 is a specific, embedded font object whose attributes (family, subtype, encoding, ToUnicode map) are recorded in the PDF. Most of what `cnv` can *eventually* do — font-name-aware heading detection, struct-tree awareness, correct ligature handling — depends on reading those attributes, and the current mupdf Rust wrapper does not expose them.

## The content stream — a tiny graphics VM

Each page's `/Contents` is a byte stream of **postfix operators**. A small operand stack, a small graphics-state stack, and maybe thirty operators you actually care about. Here is a minimal page:

```
BT                      % begin text object
  /F1 12 Tf             % select font F1 at 12 points
  72 720 Td             % move text cursor to (72, 720) in page coords
  (Hello, world.) Tj    % show the literal string
ET                      % end text object
```

Key text operators:

| op | meaning |
|---|---|
| `Tf` | select font and size |
| `Td` / `TD` / `Tm` | move or set the text matrix (cursor position) |
| `Tj` | show a string of glyphs |
| `TJ` | show an array of strings with explicit inter-glyph spacing (common in justified text) |
| `'` / `"` | newline-and-show variants |

Key graphics operators relevant to text extraction:

| op | meaning |
|---|---|
| `cm` | concatenate to current transformation matrix (rotation, scale) — rotated pages are laid out via `cm` |
| `Do` | invoke an XObject — this is how embedded images and vector-graphic symbols get pulled in |
| `m l c re h S f B W n` | path construction / fill / stroke / clip — the vector-graphics operators |

When mupdf extracts text, it interprets the content stream, tracks the transformation matrix and text matrix, and produces a list of glyphs each with an origin (x, y), a size, and a character code. `cnv` consumes that list.

The crucial thing to understand is that **there is no concept of "paragraphs" or "lines" in the content stream itself.** A PDF content stream knows only about glyphs at positions. Anything higher-level — word boundaries, line breaks, reading order, columns, tables — is *reconstructed* by the extractor from glyph positions. This is why PDF-to-text is hard and why projects like `cnv` have layers of heuristics (XY-Cut++, font-size classification, etc.) sitting on top of the raw glyph stream.

## Coordinate table reconstruction

`pdfp` now keeps word-level geometry in addition to MuPDF text blocks. Each `RawWord` carries text, bbox, font size, source block/line IDs, and baseline position. The old table path only clustered whole `RawTextBlock` bboxes, which failed on engineering catalogues where MuPDF may return an entire product table as one long text block. The coordinate path works below that level.

The native detector follows the same broad shape as text-strategy table extractors:

1. Group words into visual rows by baseline.
2. Find row runs with repeated numeric/catalogue structure.
3. Infer column centers from recurring word positions.
4. Assign words into cells by x/y coordinates.
5. Merge stacked header words where possible.
6. Score confidence before choosing an output format.

The CLI exposes this as:

```sh
pdfp convert catalogue.pdf --tables auto
pdfp convert catalogue.pdf --tables native
pdfp convert catalogue.pdf --tables layout
pdfp convert catalogue.pdf --tables off
```

`auto` emits a GFM Markdown table when confidence is high. When a region is table-like but too ambiguous, it falls back to a fenced `text` layout block rather than collapsing the table into a long paragraph. `layout` forces that fixed-width fallback, which is useful for wide manufacturer catalogues. `native` forces Markdown output for detected coordinate tables. `--debug-tables` writes JSON under `<output>/debug/tables/`.

For review-sensitive standards work, `--conservative` forces the safe table fallback, keeps formulas in audit mode, and disables rendered figure snapshot candidates. Use it when a wrong reconstruction is worse than a preserved visual/text fallback.

This is not OCR. It depends on a usable text layer. Scanned or damaged-text tables still need `--ocr auto`, `--ocr force`, or a hybrid backend before coordinate reconstruction can see words.

## Coordinate systems — two gotchas

1. **PDF page space has its origin at the bottom-left, y growing upward.** That is the classical mathematical convention but the opposite of every screen-based coordinate system you have ever touched. It is also the convention the OpenDataLoader Java implementation of XY-Cut++ uses.
2. **`cnv` uses top-left origin with y growing downward**, because that is what the mupdf Rust wrapper returns from `page.bounds()` and `block.bounds()`. So somewhere between "PDF native" and "what `cnv` sees", a flip happens.

The flip matters for two specific modules:

- `src/layout/xycut.rs` — the ported Java algorithm uses `topY > bottomY` comparisons; the Rust port inverts them to `y0 < y1`. The module doc-comment has the translation table.
- Any future direct integration with tagged-PDF tooling (pdfium-render, PDFBox) will return native PDF coordinates; conversions will have to flip.

Rotation (portrait vs landscape) is a property of the page's `/Rotate` key, applied via the initial CTM. mupdf normalises it so extracted glyphs come back in a canonical orientation. `cnv` does not handle rotated-text annotations itself — it relies on mupdf to unwind them.

## Fonts, encodings, and why text sometimes vanishes

This is the single most operationally important section of the document. It explains why `cnv` occasionally returns blank text for an equation, or why one PDF's math is perfect and the next one's has `□` in place of `∫`.

PDF supports four font types:

- **Type 1** — classic PostScript fonts. Small, old, common in academic PDFs generated by older LaTeX.
- **TrueType** — modern outline fonts. Most common today.
- **Type 3** — fonts whose glyphs are themselves small PDF content streams. Rare but seen in old TeX output and some scientific typesetters. These are effectively "draw this glyph by executing these vector-graphics operators".
- **Type 0** (also called **CID**) — composite fonts used for large character sets (CJK, Devanagari, some math fonts). Glyphs are identified by CID (character ID), not by Unicode codepoint.

For every font, the PDF optionally carries a **ToUnicode CMap** — a mapping from the internal glyph code (1 byte or 2 bytes or CID) to the actual Unicode codepoint the glyph represents. Text extraction is *only* meaningful when this map is present and accurate.

A ToUnicode CMap looks like:

```
/CIDInit /ProcSet findresource begin
12 dict begin
beginbfchar
  <0001> <0041>         % glyph 1 is Unicode U+0041 'A'
  <0002> <0042>         % glyph 2 is 'B'
  <0003> <0040>         % glyph 3 is '@'
endbfchar
```

**If the CMap is missing for a glyph**, the text extractor has to guess — or, more often, give up. In mupdf this manifests as `TextChar::char() -> None`. `cnv`'s extractor filters these out (`src/pdf/extractor.rs:203` and adjacent), meaning glyphs without Unicode mappings are **silently dropped**. No warning, no placeholder — just a hole in the output.

When does this happen?

- **Subsetted fonts with stripped ToUnicode.** LaTeX via `pdftex` routinely subsets fonts (ships only the glyphs actually used) and historically has done a mediocre job of emitting ToUnicode for math symbols. Symbols like `∫`, `∑`, `⊂`, `ℕ` can vanish.
- **Type 3 fonts.** Since the glyph is a vector-drawn path, there is nothing intrinsically tying it to a Unicode codepoint. The PDF might or might not supply a mapping.
- **Custom encodings.** Some older PDFs use `/Differences` arrays in their encoding dict to remap glyph positions — if this remapping is not reflected in the ToUnicode, text comes out as garbage.

What helps? A generic OCR pass can recover some text, but formulas need a formula-specific path. `pdfp` now detects likely formula regions from word geometry and can write `--debug-formulas` JSON plus rendered crops under `debug/formulas/`. Those crops are the right unit for a dedicated formula recognizer such as UniMERNet/PDF-Extract-Kit or a hosted API such as Mathpix. Today, the first recovery backend is Docling formula enrichment through `--hybrid docling --formulas hybrid`.

### Ligatures

Many fonts ship glyph forms for common pairs like `fi`, `fl`, `ffi`. When extracted, these should ideally round-trip back to the two or three component Unicode characters. mupdf decomposes ligatures by default. `cnv` does not pass the `PRESERVE_LIGATURES` flag, so we get the decomposed form. Good — search indexes, RAG embeddings, and markdown renderers all expect `fi` not `ﬁ`.

### Font name exposure

mupdf 0.6.0's Rust wrapper does not expose per-glyph font names. `PdfExtractor::dominant_font_name` at `src/pdf/extractor.rs:318` returns the literal string `"unknown"`. This is why `src/layout/classifier.rs` is size-only — it cannot distinguish a 10-pt heading from a 10-pt body paragraph, even when the PDF marks the former as bold Helvetica and the latter as regular Minion. Adding `pdfium-render` as a second-opinion reader for font metadata is Phase 3 of the plan.

## The structure tree — what "tagged PDF" means

PDF 1.4 introduced a parallel data structure called the **structure tree**. It lives at `/Catalog → /StructTreeRoot` and mirrors the document's logical structure — chapters, sections, paragraphs, figures, tables — entirely independently of where those items are physically drawn on the page. A well-tagged PDF reads like a DOM tree:

```
StructTreeRoot
├── H1 ("Abstract")
│   └── P (alt: "We propose a Transformer...")
├── H1 ("1 Introduction")
│   ├── P
│   ├── P
│   └── Figure (alt: "Figure 1. The Transformer architecture")
└── H1 ("2 Background")
    └── Table (summary: "Benchmark results")
        └── TR
            ├── TH (scope: col)
            ├── TH
            └── TD
```

Roles are drawn from a standard set: `H1`..`H6`, `P`, `L`, `LI`, `Figure`, `Table`, `TR`, `TD`, `TH`, `Span`, `Reference`, `Note`, etc. Anything custom can be registered in `/RoleMap`.

Each `StructElement` can carry `/Alt` text (an accessibility description), `/ActualText` (the canonical text for glyphs whose visible form is decorative), `/Lang` (language code), and references to the pages and content-stream markers where it is drawn (`/K` kids).

When present, the structure tree is *the authoritative source of truth* for what the document means. No heuristics needed — no font-size thresholds, no reading-order recovery, no caption detection. You just walk the tree.

### Who produces tagged PDFs?

- Word, via `Save As PDF/A`, produces solid tags.
- Adobe Acrobat autotags reasonably well.
- LaTeX via `\usepackage{accessibility}` or `tagpdf` can produce tags, but most academic PDFs do not use it.
- OpenDataLoader both **reads and writes** tagged PDFs (their `--format tagged-pdf` output emits `/StructTreeRoot`).

Most PDFs in the wild — especially academic arXiv PDFs — are **not tagged**. Heuristics remain necessary. But when a tagged PDF is encountered, defaulting to font-size classification is leaving free quality on the table.

### Why `cnv` does not read the struct tree today

mupdf's Rust wrapper does not surface `/StructTreeRoot`. To access it from Rust we need a different library. The research done for Phase 3 concluded that `pdfium-render` is the right path: it wraps Chromium's PDFium, exposes `FPDF_StructTree_*` bindings, and can be added behind a Cargo feature flag so the default build does not require `libpdfium` at runtime.

## Images — how they actually sit in a PDF

Images in PDFs are **XObjects** of subtype `/Image`. A single image looks like:

```
10 0 obj
<< /Type /XObject /Subtype /Image
   /Width 800 /Height 600
   /ColorSpace /DeviceRGB /BitsPerComponent 8
   /Filter /DCTDecode
   /Length 123456
>>
stream
...raw JPEG bytes...
endstream
```

The `/Filter` determines the encoding:

| Filter | What it is |
|---|---|
| `DCTDecode` | JPEG. Most common for photos. |
| `FlateDecode` | zlib-compressed raw pixels. Common for diagrams, screenshots. |
| `LZWDecode` | older TIFF-style. Rare in modern PDFs. |
| `CCITTFaxDecode` | fax compression (1-bit). Scanned black-and-white pages. |
| `JBIG2Decode` | binary-image compression. Used by heavy scan-to-PDF tools. |
| `JPXDecode` | JPEG 2000. Rare but seen in high-quality scanned docs. |

An image is invoked from a page's content stream by `/Im1 Do`. Where `Im1` is an alias in `/Resources /XObject` pointing at the XObject. The position and scaling come from the `cm` operators issued before the `Do`.

### How `pdfp` extracts images today

mupdf's `TextBlock::image()` returns an `Option<Image>` for image-type blocks. `pdfp`'s extractor (`src/pdf/extractor.rs`, Image arm in `extract_page`) calls `image.to_pixmap()` followed by `pixmap.write_to(bytes, ImageFormat::PNG)` to get PNG-encoded bytes, regardless of the original filter. That means:

- Original JPEGs are transcoded to PNG. Lossless re-encoding of a lossy source — slightly wasteful, fine in practice.
- 1-bit fax-compressed images become 24-bit PNG. Bigger files, readable output.
- JPEG 2000 and JBIG2, if mupdf's pixmap converter can decode them, round-trip to PNG. Otherwise we skip silently.

The PNG is written to `<output>/images/page{N}_img{M}.png`, and a `Block { kind: BlockKind::Image { path: "images/..." } }` is inserted into the page in Y-position order. The resulting markdown carries `![image](images/page3_img1.png)` links.

This is `--figures embedded`, the default compatibility mode.

### Figure snapshots

`--figures snapshot` takes a different path. It first detects likely figure regions from caption blocks and significant embedded-image bboxes, then renders the detected page region through MuPDF into `<output>/images/page{N}_fig{M}.png`. The rendered region can include text labels, axes, legends, vector paths, and multiple embedded images because it is captured from the painted page instead of from a single raster object.

`--figures both` emits both asset styles. `--figures none` and `--no-images` suppress both embedded images and snapshots. `--debug-figures` writes candidate JSON under `<output>/debug/figures/` with page number, bbox, caption bbox, seed image indices, confidence, and reason.

Snapshot detection is deliberately heuristic. It improves complete visual figure capture, but it is not a full semantic figure-understanding system. Blank rendered candidates are skipped.

### What `cnv` does not extract

- Vector graphics drawn via `m l c S f` — ResNet's architecture diagrams, arXiv's TikZ figures, most flow charts. mupdf classifies these as `TextBlockType::Vector`, and the embedded-image extractor drops `Vector` blocks explicitly. Snapshot mode can still capture them when the detector finds the surrounding figure region.
- Form fields (AcroForm). These are interactive UI elements laid over the page, drawn by the viewer not the content stream.
- Annotations — highlights, comments, stamps — live in `/Annots` on the page dict. We do not read them.
- Bookmarks / outlines live in `/Outlines` under the catalog. Not read.

## The full list of what `cnv` touches and what it skips

### Touched

- Content-stream text glyphs, with positions and font sizes.
- Raster image XObjects, via mupdf's `Image::to_pixmap`.
- Document-level metadata: `/Title`, `/Author`, `/Subject` from the info dictionary.

### Partially touched

- Fonts: size only. Family, weight, style, encoding are read by mupdf internally but not surfaced to our extractor.

### Skipped

- Structure tree (`/StructTreeRoot`).
- Vector graphics.
- Annotations, form fields.
- Outlines, OCG (optional content groups / layers), JavaScript, embedded files.
- Encryption — password-protected PDFs error out; no attempt to prompt for or derive the password.
- Digital signatures (we do not verify them; text beneath signed sections is extracted normally).

### Fundamentally problematic

- Glyphs whose font has no ToUnicode mapping — **silently dropped**. Biggest quality risk for math-heavy PDFs. Mitigations: formula candidate detection and `--debug-formulas` crops for audit; hybrid Docling formula enrichment; future per-crop formula OCR with UniMERNet/PDF-Extract-Kit or Mathpix.
- Mathematical equations as a whole. A PDF equation is rendered as a small block of glyph positions, sometimes drawn from multiple fonts, sometimes with symbols drawn as vector paths in Type 3 fonts. There is no `(equation)` block type in PDF. `pdfp` can detect likely equation regions and write review crops/metadata, but reliable LaTeX reconstruction requires a formula recognizer.
